# Minha Appointements Checker
A bot designed to check for available appointments on ANEM website.

**Note:**
* I couldn't run the bot on the cloud because the website only operates within Algeria. Therefore, I wrote a code that runs on ESP32, allowing me to execute the bot locally and a code that runs locally.

**How to start the bot on ESP32?**

* Upload all files on esp32_bot to the ESP32.
* Do the same steps of how to start the bot locally for config.py file.
* Enter your ID number and (numéro de demandeur d'emploi) to demande_number.
* Enter your Wi-Fi name and password into the respective fields in the config.py file
* The bot starts listening for new apppointements and send them to Telegram from ESP32.
